## Idea

A fully automated system which if provided with a fashion dress image then it can generate text describing the outfit and how it looks, and at the same time it also detects the dress' neck type, material and pattern.

The dataset is being made by me which has been scraped from Amazon, Myntra, Ajio and few other sites, on which I am constantly working upon. 


(Currently work in progress)

_currently deployment is only offline since all of my AWS credits got exhausted, will be up as soon as I get a VM_
